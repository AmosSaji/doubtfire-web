## Component Outcomes and Interactions

The expected outcomes for the `group-set-manager` component include:
- Tutors can add new members to a group.
- Tutors can update the group's name.
- The component controls the visibility of the member panel toolbar based on the presence of a unit role.

Interactions:
- Accepts and processes the following data objects:
  - `@Input() unit`: The current unit context.
  - `@Input() unitRole`: The role of the user within the unit.
  - `@Input() project`: The project associated with the group.
  - `@Input() selectedGroupSet`: The currently selected group set.
  - `@Input() showGroupSetSelector`: Boolean to show or hide the group set selector.

## Component Migration Plan

### Steps for Migration:
1. **Convert CoffeeScript to TypeScript**:
   - Migrate the logic from `group-set-manager.coffee` to TypeScript, ensuring that all AngularJS components and services are appropriately updated to Angular (Angular 2+).
2. **Update HTML template**:
   - Ensure the HTML template (`group-set-manager.tpl.html`) is compatible with Angular's newer version. Replace any deprecated AngularJS directives with their Angular equivalents.
3. **Migrate SCSS styles**:
   - Confirm that the SCSS styles are compatible with the migrated TypeScript component. Modify any class or id selectors to match changes in the HTML structure, if necessary.
4. **Testing**:
   - Test the migrated component in isolation to ensure it functions correctly.
   - Integrate the component back into the application and run end-to-end tests to verify that it works within the broader system.

### Comparison:
- **Original (CoffeeScript)**: `group-set-manager.coffee`
- **Migrated (TypeScript)**: `group-set-manager.component.ts`
